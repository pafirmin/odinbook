# Odinbook

Odinbook is a Facebook-style social networking site built as my final project of The Odin Project webdev curriculum. It is
an exercise in full-stack web development that uses the popular MERN stack for its core architecture and Cloudify for
user file storage. I decided to expand upon the core features laid out in the project specification by implementing live 
instant messaging in pop-out chat windows and a real-time notification system using Socket.io. Additionally, I added a 
togglable dark theme using the styled-components library to allow for easy theme-switching.

This was my most challenging project to date and putting it together was an amazing learning experience.
